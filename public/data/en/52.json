      "In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ, We Command You, Brothers, To Keep Away From Every Brother Who Is Idle And Does Not Live According To The Teaching You Received From Us.",
      "For You Yourselves Know How You Ought To Follow Our Example. We Were Not Idle When We Were With You,",
      "Nor Did We Eat Anyone's Food Without Paying For It. On The Contrary, We Worked Night And Day, Laboring And Toiling So That We Would Not Be A Burden To Any Of You.",
      "We Did This, Not Because We Do Not Have The Right To Such Help, But In Order To Make Ourselves A Model For You To Follow.",
