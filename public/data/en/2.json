      "If It Is A Person Sixty Years Old Or More, Set The Value Of A Male At Fifteen Shekels And Of A Female At Ten Shekels.",
      "If Anyone Making The Vow Is Too Poor To Pay The Specified Amount, He Is To Present The Person To The Priest, Who Will Set The Value For Him According To What The Man Making The Vow Can Afford.",
      "\" 'If What He Vowed Is An Animal That Is Acceptable As An Offering To The Lord , Such An Animal Given To The Lord Becomes Holy.",

      "Who Will Judge Its Quality As Good Or Bad. Whatever Value The Priest Then Sets, That Is What It Will Be.",
      "If The Owner Wishes To Redeem The Animal, He Must Add A Fifth To Its Value.",

      "But If He Dedicates His Field After The Jubilee, The Priest Will Determine The Value According To The Number Of Years That Remain Until The Next Year Of Jubilee, And Its Set Value Will Be Reduced.",
      "If The Man Who Dedicates The Field Wishes To Redeem It, He Must Add A Fifth To Its Value, And The Field Will Again Become His.",
      "If, However, He Does Not Redeem The Field, Or If He Has Sold It To Someone Else, It Can Never Be Redeemed.",
      "When The Field Is Released In The Jubilee, It Will Become Holy, Like A Field Devoted To The Lord ; It Will Become The Property Of The Priests.",
      "\" 'If A Man Dedicates To The Lord A Field He Has Bought, Which Is Not Part Of His Family Land,",
      "The Priest Will Determine Its Value Up To The Year Of Jubilee, And The Man Must Pay Its Value On That Day As Something Holy To The Lord .",
      "In The Year Of Jubilee The Field Will Revert To The Person From Whom He Bought It, The One Whose Land It Was.",
      "Every Value Is To Be Set According To The Sanctuary Shekel, Twenty Gerahs To The Shekel.",
