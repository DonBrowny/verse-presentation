      "And He Made Known To Us The Mystery Of His Will According To His Good Pleasure, Which He Purposed In Christ,",
      "To Be Put Into Effect When The Times Will Have Reached Their Fulfillment--to Bring All Things In Heaven And On Earth Together Under One Head, Even Christ.",
      "In Him We Were Also Chosen, Having Been Predestined According To The Plan Of Him Who Works Out Everything In Conformity With The Purpose Of His Will,",
      "In Order That We, Who Were The First To Hope In Christ, Might Be For The Praise Of His Glory.",
      "And You Also Were Included In Christ When You Heard The Word Of Truth, The Gospel Of Your Salvation. Having Believed, You Were Marked In Him With A Seal, The Promised Holy Spirit,",
      "Who Is A Deposit Guaranteeing Our Inheritance Until The Redemption Of Those Who Are God's Possession--to The Praise Of His Glory.",
      "For This Reason, Ever Since I Heard About Your Faith In The Lord Jesus And Your Love For All The Saints,",
      "I Have Not Stopped Giving Thanks For You, Remembering You In My Prayers.",
      "I Keep Asking That The God Of Our Lord Jesus Christ, The Glorious Father, May Give You The Spirit Of Wisdom And Revelation, So That You May Know Him Better.",
      "I Pray Also That The Eyes Of Your Heart May Be Enlightened In Order That You May Know The Hope To Which He Has Called You, The Riches Of His Glorious Inheritance In The Saints,",

      "Far Above All Rule And Authority, Power And Dominion, And Every Title That Can Be Given, Not Only In The Present Age But Also In The One To Come.",

      "All Of Us Also Lived Among Them At One Time, Gratifying The Cravings Of Our Sinful Nature And Following Its Desires And Thoughts. Like The Rest, We Were By Nature Objects Of Wrath.",
      "But Because Of His Great Love For Us, God, Who Is Rich In Mercy,",
      "Made Us Alive With Christ Even When We Were Dead In Transgressions--it Is By Grace You Have Been Saved.",

      "In Order That In The Coming Ages He Might Show The Incomparable Riches Of His Grace, Expressed In His Kindness To Us In Christ Jesus.",
      "For It Is By Grace You Have Been Saved, Through Faith--and This Not From Yourselves, It Is The Gift Of God--",
      "Not By Works, So That No One Can Boast.",
      "For We Are God's Workmanship, Created In Christ Jesus To Do Good Works, Which God Prepared In Advance For Us To Do.",

      "Remember That At That Time You Were Separate From Christ, Excluded From Citizenship In Israel And Foreigners To The Covenants Of The Promise, Without Hope And Without God In The World.",
      "But Now In Christ Jesus You Who Once Were Far Away Have Been Brought Near Through The Blood Of Christ.",
      "For He Himself Is Our Peace, Who Has Made The Two One And Has Destroyed The Barrier, The Dividing Wall Of Hostility,",
      "By Abolishing In His Flesh The Law With Its Commandments And Regulations. His Purpose Was To Create In Himself One New Man Out Of The Two, Thus Making Peace,",
      "And In This One Body To Reconcile Both Of Them To God Through The Cross, By Which He Put To Death Their Hostility.",
      "He Came And Preached Peace To You Who Were Far Away And Peace To Those Who Were Near.",
      "For Through Him We Both Have Access To The Father By One Spirit.",
      "Consequently, You Are No Longer Foreigners And Aliens, But Fellow Citizens With God's People And Members Of God's Household,",
      "Built On The Foundation Of The Apostles And Prophets, With Christ Jesus Himself As The Chief Cornerstone.",

      "In Reading This, Then, You Will Be Able To Understand My Insight Into The Mystery Of Christ,",
      "Which Was Not Made Known To Men In Other Generations As It Has Now Been Revealed By The Spirit To God's Holy Apostles And Prophets.",
      "This Mystery Is That Through The Gospel The Gentiles Are Heirs Together With Israel, Members Together Of One Body, And Sharers Together In The Promise In Christ Jesus.",
      "I Became A Servant Of This Gospel By The Gift Of God's Grace Given Me Through The Working Of His Power.",
      "Although I Am Less Than The Least Of All God's People, This Grace Was Given Me: To Preach To The Gentiles The Unsearchable Riches Of Christ,",
      "And To Make Plain To Everyone The Administration Of This Mystery, Which For Ages Past Was Kept Hidden In God, Who Created All Things.",

      "So That Christ May Dwell In Your Hearts Through Faith. And I Pray That You, Being Rooted And Established In Love,",
      "May Have Power, Together With All The Saints, To Grasp How Wide And Long And High And Deep Is The Love Of Christ,",
      "And To Know This Love That Surpasses Knowledge--that You May Be Filled To The Measure Of All The Fullness Of God.",
      "Now To Him Who Is Able To Do Immeasurably More Than All We Ask Or Imagine, According To His Power That Is At Work Within Us,",

      "Until We All Reach Unity In The Faith And In The Knowledge Of The Son Of God And Become Mature, Attaining To The Whole Measure Of The Fullness Of Christ.",
      "Then We Will No Longer Be Infants, Tossed Back And Forth By The Waves, And Blown Here And There By Every Wind Of Teaching And By The Cunning And Craftiness Of Men In Their Deceitful Scheming.",
      "Instead, Speaking The Truth In Love, We Will In All Things Grow Up Into Him Who Is The Head, That Is, Christ.",
