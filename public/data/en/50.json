      "We Always Thank God, The Father Of Our Lord Jesus Christ, When We Pray For You,",
      "Because We Have Heard Of Your Faith In Christ Jesus And Of The Love You Have For All The Saints--",
      "The Faith And Love That Spring From The Hope That Is Stored Up For You In Heaven And That You Have Already Heard About In The Word Of Truth, The Gospel",
      "That Has Come To You. All Over The World This Gospel Is Bearing Fruit And Growing, Just As It Has Been Doing Among You Since The Day You Heard It And Understood God's Grace In All Its Truth.",

      "When You Were Dead In Your Sins And In The Uncircumcision Of Your Sinful Nature, God Made You Alive With Christ. He Forgave Us All Our Sins,",
      "Having Canceled The Written Code, With Its Regulations, That Was Against Us And That Stood Opposed To Us; He Took It Away, Nailing It To The Cross.",
      "And Having Disarmed The Powers And Authorities, He Made A Public Spectacle Of Them, Triumphing Over Them By The Cross.",
      "Therefore Do Not Let Anyone Judge You By What You Eat Or Drink, Or With Regard To A Religious Festival, A New Moon Celebration Or A Sabbath Day.",
      "These Are A Shadow Of The Things That Were To Come; The Reality, However, Is Found In Christ.",
      "Do Not Let Anyone Who Delights In False Humility And The Worship Of Angels Disqualify You For The Prize. Such A Person Goes Into Great Detail About What He Has Seen, And His Unspiritual Mind Puffs Him Up With Idle Notions.",
      "He Has Lost Connection With The Head, From Whom The Whole Body, Supported And Held Together By Its Ligaments And Sinews, Grows As God Causes It To Grow.",
      "Since You Died With Christ To The Basic Principles Of This World, Why, As Though You Still Belonged To It, Do You Submit To Its Rules:",
      "\"Do Not Handle! Do Not Taste! Do Not Touch!\"?",
      "These Are All Destined To Perish With Use, Because They Are Based On Human Commands And Teachings.",
      "Such Regulations Indeed Have An Appearance Of Wisdom, With Their Self-imposed Worship, Their False Humility And Their Harsh Treatment Of The Body, But They Lack Any Value In Restraining Sensual Indulgence."

      "Because Of These, The Wrath Of God Is Coming.",
      "You Used To Walk In These Ways, In The Life You Once Lived.",
