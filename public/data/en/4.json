      "But Sihon King Of Heshbon Refused To Let Us Pass Through. For The Lord Your God Had Made His Spirit Stubborn And His Heart Obstinate In Order To Give Him Into Your Hands, As He Has Now Done.",
      "The Lord Said To Me, \"See, I Have Begun To Deliver Sihon And His Country Over To You. Now Begin To Conquer And Possess His Land.\"",
