      "Do Not Let This Book Of The Law Depart From Your Mouth; Meditate On It Day And Night, So That You May Be Careful To Do Everything Written In It. Then You Will Be Prosperous And Successful.",
      "Have I Not Commanded You? Be Strong And Courageous. Do Not Be Terrified; Do Not Be Discouraged, For The Lord Your God Will Be With You Wherever You Go.\"",

      "\"Go Through The Camp And Tell The People, 'Get Your Supplies Ready. Three Days From Now You Will Cross The Jordan Here To Go In And Take Possession Of The Land The Lord Your God Is Giving You For Your Own.' \"",
      "But To The Reubenites, The Gadites And The Half-tribe Of Manasseh, Joshua Said,",
