      "The King Assigned Them A Daily Amount Of Food And Wine From The King's Table. They Were To Be Trained For Three Years, And After That They Were To Enter The King's Service.",
      "Among These Were Some From Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael And Azariah.",
      "The Chief Official Gave Them New Names: To Daniel, The Name Belteshazzar; To Hananiah, Shadrach; To Mishael, Meshach; And To Azariah, Abednego.",
      "But Daniel Resolved Not To Defile Himself With The Royal Food And Wine, And He Asked The Chief Official For Permission Not To Defile Himself This Way.",
      "Now God Had Caused The Official To Show Favor And Sympathy To Daniel,",
      "But The Official Told Daniel, \"I Am Afraid Of My Lord The King, Who Has Assigned Your Food And Drink. Why Should He See You Looking Worse Than The Other Young Men Your Age? The King Would Then Have My Head Because Of You.\"",
      "Daniel Then Said To The Guard Whom The Chief Official Had Appointed Over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael And Azariah,",
      "\"Please Test Your Servants For Ten Days: Give Us Nothing But Vegetables To Eat And Water To Drink.",
      "Then Compare Our Appearance With That Of The Young Men Who Eat The Royal Food, And Treat Your Servants In Accordance With What You See.\"",
      "So He Agreed To This And Tested Them For Ten Days.",
      "At The End Of The Ten Days They Looked Healthier And Better Nourished Than Any Of The Young Men Who Ate The Royal Food.",
      "So The Guard Took Away Their Choice Food And The Wine They Were To Drink And Gave Them Vegetables Instead.",
      "To These Four Young Men God Gave Knowledge And Understanding Of All Kinds Of Literature And Learning. And Daniel Could Understand Visions And Dreams Of All Kinds.",
      "At The End Of The Time Set By The King To Bring Them In, The Chief Official Presented Them To Nebuchadnezzar.",
      "The King Talked With Them, And He Found None Equal To Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael And Azariah; So They Entered The King's Service.",
      "In Every Matter Of Wisdom And Understanding About Which The King Questioned Them, He Found Them Ten Times Better Than All The Magicians And Enchanters In His Whole Kingdom.",

      "In The Second Year Of His Reign, Nebuchadnezzar Had Dreams; His Mind Was Troubled And He Could Not Sleep.",

      "He Said To Them, \"I Have Had A Dream That Troubles Me And I Want To Know What It Means. \"",
      "Then The Astrologers Answered The King In Aramaic, \"O King, Live Forever! Tell Your Servants The Dream, And We Will Interpret It.\"",
      "The King Replied To The Astrologers, \"This Is What I Have Firmly Decided: If You Do Not Tell Me What My Dream Was And Interpret It, I Will Have You Cut Into Pieces And Your Houses Turned Into Piles Of Rubble.",
      "But If You Tell Me The Dream And Explain It, You Will Receive From Me Gifts And Rewards And Great Honor. So Tell Me The Dream And Interpret It For Me.\"",
      "Once More They Replied, \"Let The King Tell His Servants The Dream, And We Will Interpret It.\"",
      "Then The King Answered, \"I Am Certain That You Are Trying To Gain Time, Because You Realize That This Is What I Have Firmly Decided:",
      "If You Do Not Tell Me The Dream, There Is Just One Penalty For You. You Have Conspired To Tell Me Misleading And Wicked Things, Hoping The Situation Will Change. So Then, Tell Me The Dream, And I Will Know That You Can Interpret It For Me.\"",
      "The Astrologers Answered The King, \"There Is Not A Man On Earth Who Can Do What The King Asks! No King, However Great And Mighty, Has Ever Asked Such A Thing Of Any Magician Or Enchanter Or Astrologer.",
      "What The King Asks Is Too Difficult. No One Can Reveal It To The King Except The Gods, And They Do Not Live Among Men.\"",
      "This Made The King So Angry And Furious That He Ordered The Execution Of All The Wise Men Of Babylon.",
      "So The Decree Was Issued To Put The Wise Men To Death, And Men Were Sent To Look For Daniel And His Friends To Put Them To Death.",
      "When Arioch, The Commander Of The King's Guard, Had Gone Out To Put To Death The Wise Men Of Babylon, Daniel Spoke To Him With Wisdom And Tact.",
      "He Asked The King's Officer, \"Why Did The King Issue Such A Harsh Decree?\" Arioch Then Explained The Matter To Daniel.",

      "He Reveals Deep And Hidden Things; He Knows What Lies In Darkness, And Light Dwells With Him.",
      "I Thank And Praise You, O God Of My Fathers: You Have Given Me Wisdom And Power, You Have Made Known To Me What We Asked Of You, You Have Made Known To Us The Dream Of The King.\"",
      "Then Daniel Went To Arioch, Whom The King Had Appointed To Execute The Wise Men Of Babylon, And Said To Him, \"Do Not Execute The Wise Men Of Babylon. Take Me To The King, And I Will Interpret His Dream For Him.\"",

      "\"You Looked, O King, And There Before You Stood A Large Statue-an Enormous, Dazzling Statue, Awesome In Appearance.",
      "The Head Of The Statue Was Made Of Pure Gold, Its Chest And Arms Of Silver, Its Belly And Thighs Of Bronze,",
      "Its Legs Of Iron, Its Feet Partly Of Iron And Partly Of Baked Clay.",
      "While You Were Watching, A Rock Was Cut Out, But Not By Human Hands. It Struck The Statue On Its Feet Of Iron And Clay And Smashed Them.",
      "Then The Iron, The Clay, The Bronze, The Silver And The Gold Were Broken To Pieces At The Same Time And Became Like Chaff On A Threshing Floor In The Summer. The Wind Swept Them Away Without Leaving A Trace. But The Rock That Struck The Statue Became A Huge Mountain And Filled The Whole Earth.",
      "\"This Was The Dream, And Now We Will Interpret It To The King.",

      "\"After You, Another Kingdom Will Rise, Inferior To Yours. Next, A Third Kingdom, One Of Bronze, Will Rule Over The Whole Earth.",
      "Finally, There Will Be A Fourth Kingdom, Strong As Iron-for Iron Breaks And Smashes Everything-and As Iron Breaks Things To Pieces, So It Will Crush And Break All The Others.",
      "Just As You Saw That The Feet And Toes Were Partly Of Baked Clay And Partly Of Iron, So This Will Be A Divided Kingdom; Yet It Will Have Some Of The Strength Of Iron In It, Even As You Saw Iron Mixed With Clay.",
      "As The Toes Were Partly Iron And Partly Clay, So This Kingdom Will Be Partly Strong And Partly Brittle.",
      "And Just As You Saw The Iron Mixed With Baked Clay, So The People Will Be A Mixture And Will Not Remain United, Any More Than Iron Mixes With Clay.",
      "\"In The Time Of Those Kings, The God Of Heaven Will Set Up A Kingdom That Will Never Be Destroyed, Nor Will It Be Left To Another People. It Will Crush All Those Kingdoms And Bring Them To An End, But It Will Itself Endure Forever.",
      "This Is The Meaning Of The Vision Of The Rock Cut Out Of A Mountain, But Not By Human Hands-a Rock That Broke The Iron, The Bronze, The Clay, The Silver And The Gold To Pieces. \"The Great God Has Shown The King What Will Take Place In The Future. The Dream Is True And The Interpretation Is Trustworthy.\"",
      "Then King Nebuchadnezzar Fell Prostrate Before Daniel And Paid Him Honor And Ordered That An Offering And Incense Be Presented To Him.",
      "The King Said To Daniel, \"Surely Your God Is The God Of Gods And The Lord Of Kings And A Revealer Of Mysteries, For You Were Able To Reveal This Mystery.\"",
      "Then The King Placed Daniel In A High Position And Lavished Many Gifts On Him. He Made Him Ruler Over The Entire Province Of Babylon And Placed Him In Charge Of All Its Wise Men.",
      "Moreover, At Daniel's Request The King Appointed Shadrach, Meshach And Abednego Administrators Over The Province Of Babylon, While Daniel Himself Remained At The Royal Court."

      "Whoever Does Not Fall Down And Worship Will Immediately Be Thrown Into A Blazing Furnace.\"",

But If You Do Not Worship It, You Will Be Thrown Immediately Into A Blazing Furnace. Then What God Will Be Able To Rescue You From My Hand?\"",

      "If We Are Thrown Into The Blazing Furnace, The God We Serve Is Able To Save Us From It, And He Will Rescue Us From Your Hand, O King.",
      "But Even If He Does Not, We Want You To Know, O King, That We Will Not Serve Your Gods Or Worship The Image Of Gold You Have Set Up.\"",
      "Then Nebuchadnezzar Was Furious With Shadrach, Meshach And Abednego, And His Attitude Toward Them Changed. He Ordered The Furnace Heated Seven Times Hotter Than Usual",

      "And These Three Men, Firmly Tied, Fell Into The Blazing Furnace.",
      "Then King Nebuchadnezzar Leaped To His Feet In Amazement And Asked His Advisers, \"Weren't There Three Men That We Tied Up And Threw Into The Fire?\" They Replied, \"Certainly, O King.\"",
      "He Said, \"Look! I See Four Men Walking Around In The Fire, Unbound And Unharmed, And The Fourth Looks Like A Son Of The Gods.\"",
      "Nebuchadnezzar Then Approached The Opening Of The Blazing Furnace And Shouted, \"Shadrach, Meshach And Abednego, Servants Of The Most High God, Come Out! Come Here!\" So Shadrach, Meshach And Abednego Came Out Of The Fire,",
      "And The Satraps, Prefects, Governors And Royal Advisers Crowded Around Them. They Saw That The Fire Had Not Harmed Their Bodies, Nor Was A Hair Of Their Heads Singed; Their Robes Were Not Scorched, And There Was No Smell Of Fire On Them.",
      "Then Nebuchadnezzar Said, \"Praise Be To The God Of Shadrach, Meshach And Abednego, Who Has Sent His Angel And Rescued His Servants! They Trusted In Him And Defied The King's Command And Were Willing To Give Up Their Lives Rather Than Serve Or Worship Any God Except Their Own God.",
