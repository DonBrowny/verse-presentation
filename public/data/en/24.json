      "How Deserted Lies The City, Once So Full Of People! How Like A Widow Is She, Who Once Was Great Among The Nations! She Who Was Queen Among The Provinces Has Now Become A Slave.",
      "Bitterly She Weeps At Night, Tears Are Upon Her Cheeks. Among All Her Lovers There Is None To Comfort Her. All Her Friends Have Betrayed Her; They Have Become Her Enemies.",

      "Her Foes Have Become Her Masters; Her Enemies Are At Ease. The Lord Has Brought Her Grief Because Of Her Many Sins. Her Children Have Gone Into Exile, Captive Before The Foe.",
      "All The Splendor Has Departed From The Daughter Of Zion. Her Princes Are Like Deer That Find No Pasture; In Weakness They Have Fled Before The Pursuer.",
      "In The Days Of Her Affliction And Wandering Jerusalem Remembers All The Treasures That Were Hers In Days Of Old. When Her People Fell Into Enemy Hands, There Was No One To Help Her. Her Enemies Looked At Her And Laughed At Her Destruction.",
      "Jerusalem Has Sinned Greatly And So Has Become Unclean. All Who Honored Her Despise Her, For They Have Seen Her Nakedness; She Herself Groans And Turns Away.",
      "Her Filthiness Clung To Her Skirts; She Did Not Consider Her Future. Her Fall Was Astounding; There Was None To Comfort Her. \"Look, O Lord , On My Affliction, For The Enemy Has Triumphed.\"",
      "The Enemy Laid Hands On All Her Treasures; She Saw Pagan Nations Enter Her Sanctuary- Those You Had Forbidden To Enter Your Assembly.",
      "All Her People Groan As They Search For Bread; They Barter Their Treasures For Food To Keep Themselves Alive. \"Look, O Lord , And Consider, For I Am Despised.\"",
      "\"Is It Nothing To You, All You Who Pass By? Look Around And See. Is Any Suffering Like My Suffering That Was Inflicted On Me, That The Lord Brought On Me In The Day Of His Fierce Anger?",
      "\"From On High He Sent Fire, Sent It Down Into My Bones. He Spread A Net For My Feet And Turned Me Back. He Made Me Desolate, Faint All The Day Long.",

      "\"The Lord Has Rejected All The Warriors In My Midst; He Has Summoned An Army Against Me To Crush My Young Men. In His Winepress The Lord Has Trampled The Virgin Daughter Of Judah.",
      "\"This Is Why I Weep And My Eyes Overflow With Tears. No One Is Near To Comfort Me, No One To Restore My Spirit. My Children Are Destitute Because The Enemy Has Prevailed.\"",
      "Zion Stretches Out Her Hands, But There Is No One To Comfort Her. The Lord Has Decreed For Jacob That His Neighbors Become His Foes; Jerusalem Has Become An Unclean Thing Among Them.",
      "\"The Lord Is Righteous, Yet I Rebelled Against His Command. Listen, All You Peoples; Look Upon My Suffering. My Young Men And Maidens Have Gone Into Exile.",
      "\"I Called To My Allies But They Betrayed Me. My Priests And My Elders Perished In The City While They Searched For Food To Keep Themselves Alive.",
      "\"See, O Lord , How Distressed I Am! I Am In Torment Within, And In My Heart I Am Disturbed, For I Have Been Most Rebellious. Outside, The Sword Bereaves; Inside, There Is Only Death.",
      "\"People Have Heard My Groaning, But There Is No One To Comfort Me. All My Enemies Have Heard Of My Distress; They Rejoice At What You Have Done. May You Bring The Day You Have Announced So They May Become Like Me.",
      "\"Let All Their Wickedness Come Before You; Deal With Them As You Have Dealt With Me Because Of All My Sins. My Groans Are Many And My Heart Is Faint.\""

      "The Lord Is Like An Enemy; He Has Swallowed Up Israel. He Has Swallowed Up All Her Palaces And Destroyed Her Strongholds. He Has Multiplied Mourning And Lamentation For The Daughter Of Judah.",
      "He Has Laid Waste His Dwelling Like A Garden; He Has Destroyed His Place Of Meeting. The Lord Has Made Zion Forget Her Appointed Feasts And Her Sabbaths; In His Fierce Anger He Has Spurned Both King And Priest.",

      "The Visions Of Your Prophets Were False And Worthless; They Did Not Expose Your Sin To Ward Off Your Captivity. The Oracles They Gave You Were False And Misleading.",
      "All Who Pass Your Way Clap Their Hands At You; They Scoff And Shake Their Heads At The Daughter Of Jerusalem: \"Is This The City That Was Called The Perfection Of Beauty, The Joy Of The Whole Earth?\"",
      "All Your Enemies Open Their Mouths Wide Against You; They Scoff And Gnash Their Teeth And Say, \"We Have Swallowed Her Up. This Is The Day We Have Waited For; We Have Lived To See It.\"",
      "The Lord Has Done What He Planned; He Has Fulfilled His Word, Which He Decreed Long Ago. He Has Overthrown You Without Pity, He Has Let The Enemy Gloat Over You, He Has Exalted The Horn Of Your Foes.",
      "The Hearts Of The People Cry Out To The Lord. O Wall Of The Daughter Of Zion, Let Your Tears Flow Like A River Day And Night; Give Yourself No Relief, Your Eyes No Rest.",
      "Arise, Cry Out In The Night, As The Watches Of The Night Begin; Pour Out Your Heart Like Water In The Presence Of The Lord. Lift Up Your Hands To Him For The Lives Of Your Children, Who Faint From Hunger At The Head Of Every Street.",
      "\"Look, O Lord , And Consider: Whom Have You Ever Treated Like This? Should Women Eat Their Offspring, The Children They Have Cared For? Should Priest And Prophet Be Killed In The Sanctuary Of The Lord?",
      "\"Young And Old Lie Together In The Dust Of The Streets; My Young Men And Maidens Have Fallen By The Sword. You Have Slain Them In The Day Of Your Anger; You Have Slaughtered Them Without Pity.",
      "\"As You Summon To A Feast Day, So You Summoned Against Me Terrors On Every Side. In The Day Of The Lord 'S Anger No One Escaped Or Survived; Those I Cared For And Reared, My Enemy Has Destroyed.\""
